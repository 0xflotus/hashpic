# Roadmap

In the future maybe some other [hashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hash_functions#Non-cryptographic_hash_functions) will be also supported. 

- [Skein](https://pythonhosted.org/pyskein/skein.html#examples-of-simple-hashing)
- [Hashlib Additional](https://pypi.org/project/hashlib-additional/)
